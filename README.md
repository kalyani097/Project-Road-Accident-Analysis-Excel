# Project-Road-Accident-Analysis-Excel

## 📊 Overview  

This project provides an interactive **Excel Dashboard** for analyzing road accident data. The dashboard visualizes key accident statistics, including casualties by vehicle type, accident locations, road types, lighting conditions, and monthly trends.  

## 📂 Project Files  

- **`Road Accident Analysis Dataset.xlsx`** – The dataset containing road accident records.  
- **`Road Accident Analysis Dashboard.pdf`** – A snapshot of the Excel dashboard.  

## 📈 Key Insights  

- **Total Casualties:** 417,883  
- **Casualty Severity:**  
  - Fatal: 7,135  
  - Serious: 59,312  
  - Slight: 351,436  
- **Most Affected Vehicle Type:** Cars (79.8% of total casualties)  
- **Accidents by Area:** Higher number in urban areas compared to rural areas  
- **Monthly Trends:** Varies across the year with peaks in certain months  
  

## 📌 Features  

✔️ **Casualty Statistics** – Breakdown by severity  
✔️ **Vehicle Type Analysis** – Identifies which vehicles are most involved  
✔️ **Road & Lighting Conditions** – Insights into accident-prone locations  
✔️ **Monthly Trends** – Compare current and previous year’s accident trends  
 


## **1️⃣ Data Insights & Interpretation**   

- **Severity of Accidents:**  
  - The majority of casualties are **slight (84.1%)**, which means that most accidents do not result in serious harm.  
  - However, **7,135 fatalities** and **59,312 serious injuries** indicate that a substantial number of cases involve life-threatening incidents.  

- **Vehicle Type Analysis:**  
  - Cars are responsible for **almost 80%** of accidents—suggesting that private vehicles are the major contributor.  
  - Other vehicle types (bicycles, buses, tractors) have much lower casualty numbers, possibly due to fewer numbers on the road.  

- **Accident Locations & Road Types:**  
  - A high number of accidents occur on **urban roads**, likely due to high traffic density.  
  - **Single carriageways & dual carriageways** have significant casualty numbers, possibly due to higher speeds and lane changes.  
  - **Roundabouts and one-way streets** seem to have lower numbers—likely because traffic slows down in these areas.  

- **Time of Day & Light Conditions:**  
  - The dashboard suggests that **daylight hours** have more accidents than nighttime. This could be due to higher traffic volume during the day.  
  - But, **nighttime accidents are often more severe**, possibly due to poor visibility and driver fatigue.  


## **Conclusion**
The Road Accident Analysis Dashboard highlights key accident trends, revealing that most accidents are minor (84.1%), but fatal (7,135) and serious (59,312) casualties remain a concern. Cars (79.8%) are the primary vehicles involved, with urban areas seeing higher accident rates due to traffic density, while rural accidents tend to be more severe. Single and dual carriageways have the most casualties, whereas roundabouts and one-way streets are safer.

Accidents peak in certain months, with daytime having more incidents, but nighttime accidents being deadlier due to low visibility and speeding. Stronger road safety measures, improved infrastructure, driver education, and predictive analytics can help reduce accidents and enhance road safety.
